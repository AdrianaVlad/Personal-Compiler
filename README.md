Compiler for our own personal programming language, developed in a team of 2. 
Done as part of "Formal Languages, Automata and Compilers" class in 2nd year of University. 
I wrote most of the code, while my colleague helped in researh, manual testing and general suggestions. 
I made sure: 
  - the structures were properly initialized
  - the lexx file was as complite as possible, and transferred the information accurately
  - the symbol table updated and displayed correctly
  - the language did not support casts (as per the project specifications)
  - all shift/reduce conflicts are resolved in the final version
  - variables and functions need to be declared before they are used
